Using a competition dataset from Kaggle, I am creating a model to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa.

I will first build simple Linear Regression and K Nearest Neighbor models to build a baseline.

Then I will use TensorFlow to build a model and get a better sense of each attribute's weight for an accurate prediction.

With that information I will refine the Linear Regression and KNN models.

Finally, I will determine the most accurate method by comparing the results from individual models with the results of combining multiple models.
